📊 CX Shopping Behavior Analysis Project
📁 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover insights about purchase frequency, customer loyalty, product preferences, and overall customer experience (CX). The workflow involves data loading, cleaning, exploring, and visualizing using multiple tools such as Power BI, PostgreSQL, Python, and final presentation with Gamma (AI Presentation tool).

🎯 Objectives

Understand customer purchase behavior and segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal).

Analyze product preferences, pricing sensitivity, and review impact.

Identify key trends influencing customer satisfaction and retention.

Visualize findings through interactive dashboards and a presentation.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
Power BI	Initial data loading, cleaning, and visualization
PostgreSQL	Data storage, querying, and transformation using SQL
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Deep analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), insights generation
Gamma App (PPT)	AI-generated final presentation for insights and recommendations
📂 Project Workflow

Data Loading

Imported dataset using Power BI and connected to PostgreSQL.

Exported cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL tables for structured querying.

Data Transformation (SQL)

Used queries for customer segmentation, purchase trends, and aggregation.

Example: Categorizing customers as New, Returning, Loyal.

Data Analysis (Python)

Explored datasets using Pandas.

Performed EDA with visualizations (bar charts, histograms, boxplots).

Derived insights related to spending habits, frequency, and ratings.

Data Visualization (Power BI/Python)

Built dashboards illustrating key metrics such as:

Customer segment distribution

Revenue trends

Product performance

Purchase frequency

Presentation Creation (Gamma PPT)

Generated a polished presentation with storytelling and visual insights.

Included conclusions and business recommendations.

📌 Key Insights (Example – to update after analysis)

✅ Loyal customers contribute the highest revenue
✅ Rating and discount positively affect repeat purchases
✅ Most purchases occur in the electronics and fashion categories

📍 Final Output

✅ PostgreSQL SQL queries
✅ Python scripts for EDA
✅ Power BI dashboard
✅ Final Gamma Presentation (PPT)

📜 How to Run the Project

Clone this repository.

Import dataset into Power BI or PostgreSQL.

Run SQL scripts for segmentation and aggregation.

Execute Python notebook (analysis.ipynb) for EDA.

Review the final Gamma presentation for business insights.
